  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  At MyScratchBlocks we take privacy seriously. We don't track you or anything, we made this page since we need to do it. We are not intrested about selling your data, all we want is to make a better Scratch editor.

  <h2>How we put this into force</h2>
  We enforce this by doing the following things:

  - <b>No Tracking</b> - We don't track you (and everyone else as well) unlike Scratch does.
  <br>
  - <b>Privacy-Policy enforcing popups</b> - If a project you are running may breach a Privacy Violation if it was abused, a popup will show to make sure you are OK with it, and let you reject or accept it.

  <h2>Random usernames</h2>
  If you are signed out, an non-identifying username will be used to greet you. If you are signed in, you will be greeted via your username, but we may make an option to force the random usernames later on.
  It is in the format of MyScratchBlocks-Coder then a dash then 4 random numbers.

  <h2>Settings</h2>
  Setting that you set, such as addons are stored in your browser, not using a server.
  
  <h2>IPs</h2>
  IP Adresses will not be abused, they will only be used to fight spam. For example, a IP may be blocked in repsonse to abuse, but we will do nothing else with it.

  <h2>Extensions</h2>
  Extensions are privacy-protected like how we said about the Privacy-Policy enforcing popups. Otherwise, privacy is protected under the Turbowarp Privacy Policy. See myscratchblocks.github.io/scratch-gui/privacy.html for more info.

  <h2>Accounts</h2>
  Accounts are protected, we don't sell your data or anything. Account logins are processed using ScratchID, which has a non-identifying, time-limited, and short-expiry token for verfication to make sure there are no hackers.
  It even uses your Scratch Username.

  <h2>Uploaded Projects</h2>
  Uploaded projects (on the MyScratchBlocks Community) are only identifed via username, nothing else.

  <h2>Child Privacy</h2>
  If you find that your child has did things on MyScratchBlocks with an account, and you don't want that, you have the right to get your child's account suspended and data deleted.
  To do this, follow the File a Claim steps below. You also need to be able to verify that you own the account, but that's easy as providing the "Developer Token".

  <h2>File a claim</h2>
  If you think that your or someone else's privacy is being violated, you can make a claim.
  Please contact MyScratchedAccount or make a issue on our Github Repo.
  You may even get a prize, for example a badge if your feedback helped.
